linuxlab@ubuntu:~$ ./teststrings.sh str1 str2
Is string 1 zero length? Value of 1 means FALSE
1
Is string 2 nonzero length? Value of 0 means TRUE;
0
length of string1 = 4, length of string2 = 4
String 1 is the same length as string 2
String 1 is not the same as string 2
linuxlab@ubuntu:~$ ./teststrings.sh str1 str2long
Is string 1 zero length? Value of 1 means FALSE
1
Is string 2 nonzero length? Value of 0 means TRUE;
0
length of string1 = 4, length of string2 = 8
String 2 is longer than string 1
String 1 is not the same as string 2
