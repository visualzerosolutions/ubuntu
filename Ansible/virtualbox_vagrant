# This tells Vagrant that it needs to create a virtual machine with 1024mb of memory.
# We also need to tell Vagrant that we want to run Ansible on this virtual machine by
adding some instructions to the Vagrantfile, just after the configuration you just added.
Right at the bottom and before the word end, add the following contents to the file:

folder named provisioning in the current directory.
