# Parent Windows 10 Pro operating system is running Hyper-V. 
# A Hyper-V VM is also running Windows Pro and has nested virtualization enabled
# This allows us to run Hyper-V inside of that VM. 


PS C:\Windows\system32> Get-VM 'eve-ng-o' | Select-Object Name, Version

Name     Version
----     -------
eve-ng-o 9.0

#  The VM must be Hyper-V Configuration Version 8.0 or higher
#  If the configuration version is too low, then you can fix the problem by using the Update-VMVersion cmdlet followed by the VM name


# With the VM still powered off, we will need to use the Set-VMProcessor cmdlet to enable nested virtualization for the VM. 
# The required parameters include VMName and ExposeVirtualizationExtensions (which must be set to $True).

PS C:\Windows\system32> Set-VMProcessor -VMName 'eve-ng-o' -ExposeVirtualizationExtensions $True
